# Robotex
This repo contains files and images of our work at Robotex.

Robotex was founded by Sammarth Kumar, Shivaditya Bose and Aryan Jain with the aim to spread robotics education among underprivileged institutions. We create affordable robotics kits and conduct workshops in which we explain concepts of prototyping, basic circuitry and how to assemble the kits.

The kits cost less than USD 3 and are built from scratch using individual parts. We solder the components and create packages for individual kits with all the necessary components. So far we have conducted 2 live workshops and distributed 30+ kits.

Our kits teach learners basic circuitry and inform them about the basic robotic components and functions.

We thank all those who have donated to our cause.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, we have been unable to operate due to logistical issues but are working towards creating remote learning options.
